First project - html and possibly css

This project is just a noob atempt at starting to figure out how web dev works.

By the end I should've created and commited an ugly simple website just to put in practice the little bit I learned about html and maybe css later on. 

I was already familiar with html since I learned a little back in  college, some good 15 or some years ago, but I had never touched an unix command-line nor did I know what most tools I have to use were.

Being unfamiliar with code dedicated text editors I must also say I'm finding Visual Studio to be spectacular.

Lessons learned: (to be written at the end of the project).
